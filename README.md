ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arsh. I'm really interested in solving problems within Astrobiology and animal conservation using the application of technology. I love to use Python
when creating my projects. If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out to me through Linkedin. See you guys around!
